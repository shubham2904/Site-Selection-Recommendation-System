# Site-Selection-Recommendation-System

A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. Recommender Systems nowadays are very useful as they prove to be an
important source of information for the people to discover an item of their choice from selected category.

Restaurant recommendation systems are one such kind of recommenders which prove to be very useful while selecting the restaurants fulfilling certain conditions. The goal of our project is to develop an efficient recommender system for suggesting the user best restaurant satisfying given criterias of time, categories, and
location, number of check-in etc. Also, This model will help Restaurant owner to marketize and enhance their target customers.

Site selection indicates the practice of new facility location, both for business and government. Site selection involves measuring the needs of a new project against the merits of potential locations. Developing a site selection system is an integral part of our project.Site selection enables the user to select an appropriate place for opening a new restaurant. It involves the role of different factors like check-in count in a particular venue,population density in the area and density of restaurants in the area.
This model will help the users to select the best site to open a new restaurant so that he can get the maximum number of customers.
